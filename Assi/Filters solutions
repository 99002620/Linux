practice: filters

1. Put a sorted list of all bash users in bashusers.txt.

Ans:grep bash /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 | sort > bashusers.txt


2. Put a sorted list of all logged on users in onlineusers.txt.

Ans:who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort > onlineusers.txt


3. Make a list of all filenames in /etc that contain the string conf in their filename.

Ans:ls /etc | grep conf


4. Make a sorted list of all files in /etc that contain the case insensitive string conf in their filename.

Ans:ls /etc | grep -i conf | sort


5. Look at the output of /sbin/ifconfig. Write a line that displays only ip address and the subnet mask.

Ans:/sbin/ifconfig | head -2 | grep 'inet ' | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3,5


6. Write a line that removes all non-letters from a stream.

Ans:paul@deb503:~$ cat text
This is, yes really! , a text with ?&* too many str$ange# characters ;-)
paul@deb503:~$ cat text | tr -d ',!$?.*&^%#@;()-'
This is yes really  a text with  too many strange characters


7. Write a line that receives a text file, and outputs all words on a separate line.

Ans:paul@deb503:~$ cat text2 
it is very cold today without the sun

paul@deb503:~$ cat text2 | tr ' ' '\n'
it
is
very
cold
today
without
the
sun


8. Write a spell checker on the command line. (There may be a dictionary in /usr/share/dict/ .)

Ans:paul@rhel ~$ echo "The zun is shining today" > text

paul@rhel ~$ cat > DICT
is
shining
sun
the
today

paul@rhel ~$ cat text | tr 'A-Z ' 'a-z\n' | sort | uniq | comm -23 - DICT
zun
